pyglet-directions
=================

Just some directons on how to get pyglet setup on osx. Windows / Linux users come see me


## tl;dr

Just follow these steps (skip ones if you already have done it). More directions are below

1. Install XCode through the Mac App store
2. Install the command line tools 
3. Install homebrew (http://brew.sh)
4. Install extras (hg) through homebrew
5. Install pyglet through hg
6. Download avbin
7. Install avbin
8. Test all the things!

### 1. Installing XCode
Open the mac app store, search for xcode; install XCode. XCode is huge (2GB+). So go for a walk or grab a drink. This will be a while.

Q. Why do I have to install XCode?

A. Because OSX is a silly place and doesn't ship a compiler without forcing the developer download the whole XCode env...

### 2. Installing the command line tools
Open XCode(heads up, the initial load of XCode is SLOOOOOOOW) and accept the Terms of Use. Once this is done, open the preferences (cmd + ,) and go to downloads. From there select command line tools and install them.

Q. Why do I have to install the command line tools?

A. Because while XCode gets you a compiler, it doesn't include some of the helpful things / shortcuts for the command line. 

### 3. Installing homebrew
Now that you have installed XCode plus the command line tools, it's time to install homebrew. From the official docs:

````bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
````
This will downloand and install homebrew for you.  Once it's down run `brew doctor` and make sure to fix any warnings / errors that show up there. 

Q. Why do I need homebrew?

A. Homebrew is a package manager. Other sane operating systems (read Linux, not windows) already have ways of distrubuting modules of code / applications.  Homebrew is one attempt at bringing this functionality to the mac (ie fink / macports are other ones). Have you ever downloaded / installed something only to have it tell you that you need to install something else first? Package managers are a way for the computer to figure all that out for you. 



### 4. Installing extras through homebrew

````bash
brew install hg wget
````

Q. What is `hg`?

A. Hg is also known as mecurial, which is a similar tool to git that the pyglet developers chose to use instead.

### 5. installing pyglet through hg

````bash
hg clone https://pyglet.googlecode.com/hg/ && cd hg && sudo python setup.py install
````

In the cannonical documentation fashion, go get yourself a coffee as this step will take a while. Also you can download #6.

### 6. Download avbin

````bash
wget https://github.com/downloads/AVbin/AVbin/avbin-darwin-x86-64-v8.1.tar.bz2
````

Now unpackage the file and cd into the directory. 

````bash
tar -xvjf avbin-darwin-x86-64-v8.1.tar.bz2  && cd avbin-darwin-x86-64-v8.1 
````

`tar -xvjf` will unpackage the archive and `cd` will well, `cd` into the unpacked directory

### 7. Install avbin
````bash
sudo ./install.sh
````

### 8. Test all the things

Open the python shell and runn the following commands. Your output should look similarish. If any of these don't work, something probably went wrong. 

````python
>>> import pyglet
>>> print(pyglet.version)
1.2alpha1
>>> print(pyglet.media.have_avbin)
2013-06-05 18:01:35.942 Python[9829:1307] ApplePersistenceIgnoreState: Existing state will not be touched. New state will be written to /var/folders/5q/2x6kltrj12s4wgb18hnbkrtc0000gn/T/org.python.python.savedState

>>> print(pyglet.media.avbin.get_version())
